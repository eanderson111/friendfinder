Title: NativeNomad

I tried to give a friendfinder assignment a useful dimension. I am originally from Croatia and a lot of people find me through various friends seeking advice on where to go when they travel to Croatia. People want travel advice from people who are familiar with the place they're going and could give them good tips. So NativeNomad is a service that matches travellers with locals for personalized travel advice. 

Unfortunately, I struggled and had to submit before I could build the matchmaking logic. I hope to return to it later in May when we seem to have a short break. 

To get the app running, run "npm i" to install the packages. Once installed, open "server.js" in the terminal to start the server listening. The app is setup to run on localhost: 8080.
